    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we showed that executing a calculation (created using delayed) with the distributed executor is identical to any other executor. However, we now have access to additional functionality, and control over what data is held in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `futures` interface (derived from the built-in `concurrent.futures`) provide fine-grained real-time execution for custom situations. We can submit individual functions for evaluation with one set of inputs, or evaluated over a sequence of inputs with `submit()` and `map()`. The call returns immediately, giving one or more *futures*, whose status begins as \"pending\" and later becomes \"finished\". There is no blocking of the local Python session.\n",

Most of the loading functions within Dask, such as `dd.read_csv`, work this way. Similarly, we normally don't want to `gather()` results that are too big in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [full API](http://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) of the distributed scheduler gives details of interacting with the cluster, which remember, can be on your local machine or possibly on a massive computational resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "The futures API offers a work submission style that can easily emulate the map/reduce paradigm (see `client.map()`) that may be familiar to many people. The intermediate results, represented by futures, can be passed to new tasks without having to bring the pull locally from the cluster, and new work can be assigned to work on the output of previous jobs that haven't even begun yet."
